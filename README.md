# The Reaction Game (ENGR 103 Final)
Harvey Beleiciks

# Objective
A game where the objective is to click the left button as a moving LED crosses the two target LEDs (LED 4 & 5). When successful, the difficulty increases by making the moving LED faster and a value of 1 is added to the player's score. When unsuccessful (meaning the players pressed the left button when the moving LED was not on target), target LEDs turn red and the board plays a sad tune. It also resets the score and difficulty automatically. The right button is a reset switch that resets the score and the speed of the LED. The switch works like an ON/OFF switch. After each score, the serial monitor prints back the player's score. After the player reaches a score of 10, the speakers say, “Bravo!” and gives the player an extra point. The goal is to score as many points as possible.
